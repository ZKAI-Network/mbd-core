# Basic usage

## Note:
- never put dependency in `requirements.txt` directly, always put dependency in `requirements.in`
- `requirements.txt` will be generated by running `make fix-lint`

## Available commands
Usually, you should run below commands in order before you commit your code.

1. To auto-fix your lint error, auto-format your code, update the requirements, run:
    ```
    make fix-lint
    ```

    This will take a couple of minutes to finish if you run it the first time or you have added new dependencies into `requirements.in`, otherwise this will be very fast.

2. To check if there is any lint error, run:
    ```
    make lint
    ```
    If there is any error that can't be auto-fixed by `make fix-lint`, you need to fix it manually.

3. To run all the tests, and get coverage report, run:
    ```
    make test
    ```
